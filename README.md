About
=====

This extension adds a themable background image to the page indicator of the iOS home screen.

Credit
======

This extension is inspired by the ["Depth" theme](http://j-o-n-i-b-o-y.deviantart.com/art/Depth-Page-Indicator-background-309756278), created by Jona ("Joniboy") from deviantART.

Jona has gratiously contributed a version of his theme for use with this extension. The theme, "Depth for PIB", is included in this repository (and the built package) and can be enabled in WinterBoard's settings panel.

Customization
============

The image used for the background can be customized by creating a WinterBoard theme. The included Depth theme can be used as a model. (Note, though, that only the PIBPageIndicatorBG* files are necessary; the WallpaperGradient* files are unrelated to this extension.)
